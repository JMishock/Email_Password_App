Email and Password Application

This is a simple application presented in the Udemy.com course "React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
by Maximlian Schwarzmuller.


This simple application verifies a user input their e-mail and passord.
The information field is initially red until the user begins to fill it out, in which the background turns blue for the email and purple for the password.
The password must be at least seven characters long.
