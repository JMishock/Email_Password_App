Email and Password Application

This is a simple application presented in the Udemy.com course "React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
by Maximlian Schwarzmuller.


This simple application verifies a user input their e-mail and passord.
The information field is initially red until the user begins to fill it out, in which the background turns blue for the email and purple for the password.
The password must be at least seven characters long.

This application taught me how to create a simple application that uses a user's e-mail and password for verification and to execute error messages if the field does not meet the minimum requirement.


Running the attached code You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it. To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first. Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder). Run npm start to pull up application on your computer. Important: You always download the entire branch content!

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)
